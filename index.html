                <span class="title">Caydn Baldwin</span> is a growing composer seeking to heal the individual through
                his
                beautiful compositions. He began his career bringing a new perspective of beautiful dissonance to pop
                music
                but would later dedicate himself to eye opening new age music. His first song, "Why Music," was written
                his
                junior year of high school in 2019. He nourished his crave for beauty in music through debuting his
                first
                choral piece, "My Soul" at his senior concert. He would later enter both pieces into the 2021 NAfME
                Composer's Competition where he received outstanding feedback from the judges. Immediately after high
                school, he left his future opportunities behind to serve a 2-year voluntary service mission in
                Retalhuleu,
                Guatemala. During his time there he wrote many songs dedicated to building the faith of his friends,
                American and Guatemalan alike. All the while, expanding his musical repertoire from English to also
                Spanish.
                Upon return home from his mission he would continue composing new pieces, still seeking to reach people
                at
                an individual level and heal them musically. He would soon formally release his first official song,
                "Majesty," onto all music streaming platforms and currently plans to release more songs in the near
                future.

                <span class="title">Majesty</span> is the first song that Caydn formally released. It was written upon
                return home from his 2-year voluntary service mission in Guatemala. The music is illustrative of the
                majestic power that God has on our lives. Majestic in the sense that He is all powerful and can choose
                to work miracles in our life according to His will and desire. But also, majestic in the sense of
                beauty. The song is evidently inspired by the beautiful mountaineous terrain of Rio Blanco, Guatemala
                and Provo, Utah, hence the chosen cover photo for the release. The summits and vallies of the melody
                vividly illustrate the natural beauty of the mountains, while the jaw-dropping beauty of the climax of
                the song demonstrate the awing reverence felt towards God, submitting to His majesty.

                <span class="title">My Soul</span> is an original choral piece that Caydn composed his senior year of
                high school. It blends a new age piano structure with contemporary choral music, all while truly
                belonging to the hymnal genre. The real beauty of the piece is hidden behind the message and inspiration
                that came from revelatory experiences that Caydn underwent while coping with the death of his
                grandfather and best friend, Dennis Schanz. It was debuted at Caydn's senior concert.

                agreed that he should put a poem to it and then compose music for it. It is an upbeat and friendly
                song designed to be an uplifting piece of music for all to enjoy.

                <span class="title">Heartbroken</span> is a song that expresses the dearest longings of the heart. It
                was written Caydn's senior year of high school. An interesting approach was taking in the lyric writing
                where rather than focusing the song about just one girl, he based the song off what he remembered
                feeling for every girl of he had ever liked that rejected him.

                <span class="title">Mi Misi√≥n</span> is a dedicatory heart-warming song that Caydn wrote in the last
                area of his mission. It walks the listener through leaving God's presence, coming to Earth, and
                returning to God again. It is a beautiful piece that expands his repertoire to Spanish audiences to.

                <span class="title">Our Cross</span> is another piece written by Caydn on his mission. In his first
                transfer, he read Jesus the Christ by James E. Talmage. The beginning of Chapter 35, "Death and Burial"
                discusses Christ physically carrying the cross down the path towards Calvary. It describes every detail
                that the scriptures provide about His suffering. The paragraph touched Caydn's heart and he wrote a poem
                about the experience. It wasn't until a year later, when hearing his friend's tragic story of the
                metaphorical cross that they carried that he was inspired with the final lyrics and melody for the song.
                This song serves as an aid to all people as they carry their own cross in life.

            <p>
                <span class="title">Why Music?</span> is the first song that Caydn wrote. The lyrical approach is
                intriguing because he chose to focus more on music itself rather than love for any particular subject.
                The song is simply a ballad to music. This song was 1 of 2 of Caydn's works that were
                submitted into the 2021 NAfME Composer's Competition. One respectable commentary made by the judges was
                an amazement at his outstanding lyric-writing abilities.
